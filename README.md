The Customize Personality using AI  project aims to develop a web-based application that utilizes machine learning techniques to predict a user's personality based on various input data sources. The application consists of several modules, including Registration, Login, Password Reset, Update Profile, Input-CSV File Data Import, Input-Quiz Based, Input-Text-Based Data Entry, Assessment, reCAPTCHA, Download Results, Ratings, Reviews, and Notification. The project adheres to the following requirements: the use of JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, and CSS for web development, Angular 14 as a framework, AWS/OCI for hosting, MySQL as a backend database, and Python (>=3.7 or 2.7) for development. 
To ensure efficient and effective development, the project utilizes a specific technology stack. JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, and CSS are chosen for web development due to their widespread support, versatility, and ease of use. Angular 14 was selected as the framework for its robustness, scalability, and extensive community support. AWS/OCI is chosen for hosting due to their reliability, scalability, and availability of various services. MySQL is selected as the backend database for its stability, performance, and compatibility with the chosen hosting platforms. 

The User will be able to access the following modules in the Application with the functionalities.
